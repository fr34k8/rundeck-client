# rundeck-client

Most of this is borrowed from github.com/lusis/go-rundeck. It is using rundeck.v12 as a library and re-implementing his standalone binaries as functions so we can get one single command/entry point.

Hopefully lots more to be added soon.

TODO
- add node list
- add node filters (done)
- add tab/auto completion
- get the execution state of a job after executing it
- add ability to run adhoc scripts
